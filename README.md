##Main technologies used
 
###Server-side Language :

 >The back-end is written in server-side JavaScript (NodeJS) -
  + This is mainly because of its event-driven and non-blocking I/O model (event-loop + node clustering) 

  + This project will initially serve as a web app but will later be shipped into Mobile , Desktop Apps and more ...therefore there is need to build it with a REST API in mind closely with JSON , something that PHP is not very good at.

###Database:

 >The database we will be using MongoDB :
  + Provides a rich way to interact with JSON especially when working with REST APIs
  + It works well with NOodeJS (It is part of the MEAN stack)
